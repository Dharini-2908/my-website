"Trees are poems the earth writes upon the sky, / We fell them down and turn them into paper, 
/ That we may record our emptiness," or the simple beauty of a moment:
"The sun is shining fresh and bright / the sky outside is clear and blue 
/ my mind is calm my heart is light 
/ today will be a good day too".
